## Flagship
Your Flagship is the heart of the battle. If it’s destroyed, you lose the battle. 
Your Flagship comes with 4 main stats:
    • Hull
        ◦ The “health”
    • Shield
        ◦ A second layer of defense, gained through SE cards
    • Attack
        ◦ How hard Flagship hits with its SE cards
        ◦ Ram: If a Flagship is adjacent to the opposing Flagship, there’s an option to Ram 
            ▪ 1 Attack → Opposing Flagship
            ▪ 2 damage to Hull 
    • Speed
        ◦ How many grid spots are traversed per turn
        ◦ Default 1
There are 5 SE slots you can fill on your Flagship.
# Equipment Cards
## Ship Equipment (SE)
An SE or Ship Equipment card is an extension to your Flagship. They each have the potential to boost at least 1 ship stat.
### Power Cells
Each SE takes a certain amount of Power to use, including movement. You have a predefined 5 power cells to work with per turn, which replenish each turn.
### Installing
Each SE card takes 1 turn to Install. Keep the card flipped over until it is Installed.
### Salvaging
You may want to change out your equipment, but you’ve already reached max slots. You can spend a turn to Salvage an SE card, and draw a new one.
